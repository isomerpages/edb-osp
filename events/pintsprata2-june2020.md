Thank you for the overwhelming support for the Singapore Global Network (SGN) x SYNC’s inaugural Pints and Prata (P&P) Women in Tech on 2 May 2020! 

For our second P&P on 13 June 2020, SGN is partnering Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) and Government Technology Agency (GovTech) to tackle a topic that we might, as at some point of our lives, ask: “is it time for a career pivot”?
 
##### Pints & Prata #2 - Pivoting to Tech

We all know that the tech industry is booming. The number of millennials and mid-careerists making the leap to the tech industry is on the rise, and for good reason. How does one make the leap into the tech industry without any prior experience? While it might seem daunting, forging a new career in tech after spending years in a different field is within your grasp. Join our webinar and find out more from London-based Singaporeans Nicholas Foo and Elizabeth Ho, who have made the successful transition.
