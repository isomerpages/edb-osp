#### About Our Speakers

Session #1 - 30 July 2020, 4pm SGT 
Featuring Ray Poh from Artisan Green 

Motivated to contribute to sustainability, Ray made a major career change from the casino gaming industry to urban farming. Starting from ground zero, intensive research and networking led Ray to launch indoor hydroponics farm Artisan Green in 2018. Located in the neighbourhood of Kallang in Singapore, Artisan Green specialises in growing baby spinach, with the aim of providing fresh greens for the local community.  

Ray is the resident farmer and founder at Artisan Green. He previously lived in Australia for a decade, and is a University of Melbourne alumni. 

Session #2 - 17 September 2020, 4pm SGT 
Featuring Jeff Yeo from Big Tiny 

Inspired by a holiday down Australia’s Great Ocean Road, Big Tiny was founded in 2017, with ecotourism as its ethos. Big Tiny builds tiny houses on wheels, which are parked in the great outdoors and can be rented out for tourists’ accommodation. Big Tiny hopes to give urbanites the experience of waking up amidst Mother Nature, while also contributing to the livelihoods of rural landowners.  

Jeff is one of three co-founders of Big Tiny. Headquartered in Singapore, its tiny houses can be found across Australia and New Zealand.
