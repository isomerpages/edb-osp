### Lockdown Cooking: Beyond Borders

_In the second of our three-part series on Lockdown Cooking, Lim Monica Devi, a Singaporean in Belgium seeks out the Singaporean community around the world to share a common love – food! She will be speaking to them about their journeys and joys during the global lockdown, including their favourite dishes to make and memories of the Little Red Dot. Get your forks ready as she dishes out this month’s flavours: international recipes from Italy, Greece, and India. And if you wish, of course you can adapt the recipes to suit your taste – just go easy on the chilli (or not)!_

“It’s the new language,” replied Karen. “The new language is social distancing and more hygiene.”

I was intrigued. I had just asked _Karen Margaret Skading_, a fashion business owner who lives in Amersfoort (The Netherlands), how being an Overseas Singaporean who had already had to adapt to a new country was helping her to adapt to the new global situation.

“When I first moved here, I had to learn to understand the culture. I had to inculcate understanding and tolerance in a new country. Above all, learn a new language,” continued Karen. “That’s also how I deal with COVID-19. Firstly, by understanding the importance of social distancing. And then, tolerance during the lockdown. We have to understand the nature of the disease, and that by staying indoors we are helping to not spread the disease.”

I liked Karen’s calm and matter-of-fact approach to this global pandemic. I reached out to more of the Singaporean diaspora and asked them how they were coping with the various quarantine measures. As food plays a central role in many of our lives – whether we are creating it or eating it – I was especially curious about their approaches to “lockdown cooking”.

Based in Bangkok (Thailand), arts manager _Wahyuni Hadi’s_ answer to my question on where she got her inspiration for new dishes daily was “Friends are very forthcoming in sharing recipes… and it is fun to see what everyone is up to. I cook pretty regularly so nothing much has changed. One my new favourites is a recipe for Greek Chicken Marinade by The Forked Spoon, a blog offering healthy family-friendly recipes.”

_Jean Winter-Yeow, based in Dubai_

The COVID-19 lockdown has indeed increased the time available for family bonding. With the onset of the pandemic, Jean Winter-Yeow, an F&B consultant who also owns an events management company, travels less for work. A serial expatriate currently in Dubai (UAE), she says, “My husband and the kids love that I am able to cook more for the family. They missed my cooking when I travelled so much for work - usually our helper cooks the daily meals. Home-cooked meals and having dinner together every night binds the family unit closer together. Pasta vongole is a favourite of my husband’s – I learnt how to make this when we were in Italy. Wherever we’ve lived, I’ve picked up some of the local favourites and create fusion dishes to suit our family’s taste buds.”

In contrast, expanding one’s taste preferences and learning how to cook new cuisines is how others approach their daily cooking routine. Without having to commute to the office in heavy traffic or to homeschool their young children, the enforced homestay has afforded some the luxury of extra time. 
For example, although home delivery service remains available in The Netherlands, Karen who usually cooks simply during the week decided to learn more complicated dishes. “Recently, I learnt how to make a whole Indian meal for the first time including dishes like biryani, dhal and chicken vindaloo. I browse for recipes on Google. But my comfort food is Shepherd’s Pie.” 
Do you have a favourite go-to comfort dish? Next month, I speak to more Singaporeans living abroad to find out how they stay connected to the Little Red Dot through their cooking.
For now, how about trying one of the recipes here below – it might become one of your favourites too.

#### Instructions:

1.	Rinse the clams with water and let them sit for 30 minutes in water for the sand and impurities to sink to the bottom of the bowl. Repeat this step 2-3 times.
2.	Boil a pot of water with a tablespoon of salt for the pasta. 
3.	Heat some olive oil before sautéing the garlic and some dried chilli flakes for a few seconds until the flavour is released. Add the cherry tomatoes and half the parsley and sauté for another 20-30 seconds. 
4.	Add the clams with a splash of white wine (or soya sauce) and cover the pot. 
5.	Boil the spaghetti for 6-7 minutes until al dente. 
6.	Check on the clams every 5 minutes and gently stir the clams around until all open. (You will also have a very lovely stock at the bottom of the pot.) 
7.	Drain the spaghetti and keep some of the cooking water for if the pasta needs a little more liquid.
8.	Toss your spaghetti and the clams together evenly.
9.	Top with the remaining fresh parsley and serve immediately.
