### What If.

_2020 is an unprecedented year for all of us. Some of us may be fearful, some optimistic. Some could be very anxious, and perhaps some excited. But no doubt 2020 is a year of learning, of survival, of trials and of successes. Hear from Harshika, as she shares snippets of her thoughts through the past couple months._

What if I told you that 2020 should not be cancelled?

What if 2020 was here because we asked for it?

What if 2020 came with lessons we can spend lifetimes trying to learn?

What if 2020 was the highlight year of our lives?

What if 2020 reminded us that when things got rough the safest place to be was at home?

What if 2020 renewed our bonds with the people that truly matter and those who didn’t make the cut were never meant to be with us?

What if 2020 made us think that “This is how it has always been” is the an ignorant, most dangerous stance to maintain?

What if 2020 made us question everything - right from status quo to discrimination to coping mechanisms?

What if 2020 gave us answers to all of those too and we just haven’t looked for them in the right places?

What if 2020 was the greatest teacher of self care?

What if 2020 goes down in history for pushing us outside our comfort zones?

What if 2020 remained while all else faded?

What if 2020 is inertia, and the best is yet to come?

What if 2020 was never meant to be easy? Never meant to be a cakewalk? Never meant to be what you wanted it to be?

What if 2020 was the biggest challenge because we only grow in face of adversities?

What if 2020 taught us that the greatest illusion is control?

What if in 2020 we learnt to let go?

What if 2020 is leaving behind messages we are yet to even read?

What if 2020 has more in store?

What if 2020 is amazing?

What if 2020 made us aware?

What if 2020 was a catalyst for change that we much needed?

What if 2020 survived and we didn’t because we didn’t adapt?

What if 2020 selected us because we were survivors?

What if 2020 turned you into a victor?

What if 2020 turned you into a savior?

What if 2020 changed your life and there is no going back?

What if 2020 gave you the way out?

What if 2020 drowned us so we learn to save ourselves first?

What if 2020 immersed us so deeply in ourselves that we won’t ever believe what anyone else has to say about us?

What if 2020 grounded you in so deep that you stand tall like a tree unwavering?

What if the roots grow so strong that it can weather any storm?

What if 2020 made you cry?

What if 2020 made you laugh?

What if 2020 treated you right?

What if 2020 actually gave you everything that you asked for?

What if 2020 amazed you, stunned you, provoked you, made you ask the harder questions?

What if 2020 isn’t a mistake but a correction of all mistakes?

What if 2020 is the foundation on which the future is being laid?

What if 2020 was taken away and none of this ever happened?

<br> What if 2020 never happened?
